## Introduction

Accurate forest inventories are very important for economic and ecological 
development (Qi, 2016). Forest canopy cover, canopy density, and tree heights 
are commonly used indicators for timber resources. Remote sensing techniques 
have shown great advantages in producing this information with high precision 
when compared to traditional forest inventories (Korhonen, 2011). By including a 
distribution of points within a three dimensional volume of space above the 
ground, Lidar data has emerged as the one of the most effective remote sensing 
techniques for observing canopy vertical structure (Alistair, 2009). NASA’s 
Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is a full wavelength Lidar 
instruments which designed specifically to provide needed ecosystem structure 
measurements. It currently is the highest resolution and densest sampling of 
any Lidar ever put into orbit. GEDI provides points in a larger footprint than 
traditional drone/aerial platforms and provides regular coverage across Earth. 
From GEDI waveforms, four types of vegetation structure information can be 
extracted: surface topography, canopy height metrics, canopy cover metrics, and 
vertical structure metrics. This research aims to explore the use of LiDAR data 
collected from the GEDI satellite system to characterize vegetation in 
Cordillera Azul National Park in Peru at finer resolution, accuracy and 
coverage. The goal is to get an idea of what GEDI can measure regarding canopy 
cover and relative height metrics and to develop tools for further analysis.

## Methodology

The spatial data for our study area was provided by our project partners. The 
GEDI data for this project was downloaded from USGS and consists of Geolocated 
waveforms (Level 1B), Elevation and Height Metrics (Level 2A), and Canopy Cover 
Fraction and Leaf Area Index (Level 2B). For the purposes of analysis of 
vegetation in Cordillera National Park we used the Level 2A and 2B data, 
focusing on the relative height metrics and plant area index. We intersected
each of these with the different zones within our study area: the national park,
buffer around the park, and overlapping cacao fields. The distance from roads 
for each data point was calculated through code supplied by Professor Estes. 
These subsets are all displayed through boxplot. For the tool-developing aspect 
of the project we developed code based upon the rGEDI package developed by 
Carlos Alberto Silva and his team. We refined these for use in our study area, 
intersected data with shapefiles and bounding boxes, and created boxplots of 
subsections of the data. The final code developed for this project can be found 
in two rmarkdown files in the working folder. The first file is called 
“GEDI_GetData.Rmd”. This file walks through downloading each level of data 
separately, then converting the data into shapefiles and exporting, and finally 
clipping these shapefiles to either a bounding box or another shapefile. The 
second file, called “GEDI_Visualizations” uses the exported shapefile to 
visualize data through maps boxplots. 

Below are some example codes to preprocess and visualize data:

### Reading in and displaying clipped shapefiles [SW & AP]

```{r, eval=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Read in study region shapefile and clipped level 2A and 2B
studyRegion <- st_read(dsn = paste0(data_fold, "/study_region.shp"))
level2a_SA <- st_read(dsn = paste0(data_fold, "/SA_GEDI02_A.shp"))
level2b_SA <- st_read(dsn = paste0(data_fold, "/SA_GEDI02_B.shp"))

#get AOI coordinate system and set shapefile to that 
reference <- st_crs(studyarea$aoi)
st_crs(level2a_SA) <- reference
st_crs(level2b_SA) <- reference

#Display heads of 2A and 2B data
head(level2a_SA)
head(level2b_SA)
```

## Create Boxplots - Relative Height and Zones [SW & WC]

### Preprocessing

Additional preprocessing is necessary for creating boxplots of zones as 
Individual dataframes need to be made in order to be bound by the full extent
of the study area. This code chunk demonstrates summary statistics for 
summarizing rh levels in level2A clipped to the study area.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Intersect level 2A data shapefile with zones
cacao_intersect <- st_intersection(x = studyarea$cacao_zone, y = level2a_SA)
park_intersect <- st_intersection(x = studyarea$np, y = level2a_SA)
buffer_intersect <- st_intersection(x = studyarea$buffer, y = level2a_SA)

#Create Relative Height 25 Variable
cacao_RH25 <- cacao_intersect$rh25 %>% as_data_frame(.) %>%
  mutate(zone = "Cacao", level = "rh25")
park_RH25 <- park_intersect$rh25 %>% as_data_frame(.) %>%
  mutate(zone = "Park", level = "rh25")
buffer_RH25 <- buffer_intersect$rh25 %>% as_data_frame(.) %>%
  mutate(zone = "Buffer", level = "rh25")

#Create Relative Height 50 Variable
cacao_RH50 <- cacao_intersect$rh50 %>% as_data_frame(.) %>%
  mutate(zone = "Cacao", level = "rh50")
park_RH50 <- park_intersect$rh50 %>% as_data_frame(.) %>%
  mutate(zone = "Park", level = "rh50")
buffer_RH50 <- buffer_intersect$rh50 %>% as_data_frame(.) %>%
  mutate(zone = "Buffer", level = "rh50")

#Create Relative Height 75 Variable
cacao_RH75 <- cacao_intersect$rh75 %>% as_data_frame(.) %>%
  mutate(zone = "Cacao", level = "rh75")
park_RH75 <- park_intersect$rh75 %>% as_data_frame(.) %>%
  mutate(zone = "Park", level = "rh75")
buffer_RH75 <- buffer_intersect$rh75 %>% as_data_frame(.) %>%
  mutate(zone = "Buffer", level = "rh75")

#Create Relative Height 100 Variable
cacao_RH100 <- cacao_intersect$rh100 %>% as_data_frame(.) %>%
  mutate(zone = "Cacao", level = "rh100")
park_RH100 <- park_intersect$rh100 %>% as_data_frame(.) %>%
  mutate(zone = "Park", level = "rh100")
buffer_RH100 <- buffer_intersect$rh100 %>% as_data_frame(.) %>%
  mutate(zone = "Buffer", level = "rh100")

#bind all RH levels
rh_bound <- rbind(cacao_RH25, park_RH25, buffer_RH25, cacao_RH50,
                  park_RH50, buffer_RH50, cacao_RH75, park_RH75,
                  buffer_RH75, cacao_RH100, park_RH100, buffer_RH100)

#Display mean rh value of each level and zone
rh_bound %>% group_by(zone, level) %>% summarise_all(funs(mean))
```

### Plot

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#plot RH levels
rhplot <- rh_bound %>% ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = level, y = value, fill = zone)) + xlab(NULL) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("light blue", "tan", "dark green")) +
  ggtitle("Relative Height Metrics Between Geometries")

#display

                                  height = 3))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", out.height ="60%",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("external/presentation/rhplot.png"))
```

## Create Boxplots - Plant Area Index and Zones [SW & WC]

### Preprocessing

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Remove -9999 from PAI metric
clipped_2B[clipped_2B$pai == -9999] <- NA

#clip clipped shapefile to different zones
cacao_PAI <- st_intersection(x = studyarea$cacao_zone, y = clipped_2B)
park_PAI <- st_intersection(x = studyarea$park, y = clipped_2B)
buffer_PAI <- st_intersection(x = studyarea$buffer, y = clipped_2B)

#make PAI dataframes for each zone
cacao_PAI <- cacao_PAI$pai %>% as_data_frame(.) %>% mutate(zone = "Cacao")
park_PAI <- park_PAI$pai %>% as_data_frame(.) %>% mutate(zone = "Park")
buffer_PAI <- buffer_PAI$pai %>% as_data_frame(.) %>% mutate(zone = "Buffer")

#bind PAI zones
pai_bound <- rbind(cacao_PAI, park_PAI, buffer_PAI)

#Display mean PAI value of each zone
pai_bound %>% group_by(zone) %>% summarise_all(funs(mean))
```

### Plot

#set color pallette
clrs <- c("light blue", "tan", "dark green")

#create plot
paiplot <- pai_bound %>% ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = zone, y = value, fill = zone)) + xlab(NULL) +
  ggtitle("Plant Area Index Metrics by Zone") + scale_fill_manual(values = clrs)

```

## Create Boxplots - Relative Height and Road Distance [SW & WC]

### Preprocessing

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Create dataframes for each rh level

#distances <- gedi_ss$distclass %>% as_data_frame(.) %>% mutate(distances = value)
rh25 <- gedi_ss$rh25 %>% as_data_frame(.) %>% mutate(level = "rh25")
rh50 <- gedi_ss$rh50 %>% as_data_frame(.) %>% mutate(level = "rh50")
rh75 <- gedi_ss$rh75 %>% as_data_frame(.) %>% mutate(level = "rh75")
rh100 <- gedi_ss$rh100 %>% as_data_frame(.) %>% mutate(level = "rh100")
road_class <- gedi_ss$distclass %>% as_data_frame(.) %>%
  mutate(distances = value)

#bind all of the rh levels and road class
allrhlevels <- rbind(rh25, rh50, rh75, rh100) #bind rh level
gediss_bind <- cbind(road_class, allrhlevels) #add road class
road_rh_levels <- gediss_bind[-c(1)] #remove extra value column

#Display mean PAI value of each zone
road_rh_levels %>% group_by(distances, level) %>% summarise_all(funs(mean))
```

### Plot

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#create plot
roads_rhplot <- road_rh_levels %>% ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = level, y = value, fill = distances)) + xlab(NULL) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#f0f9e8", "#ccebc5", "#a8ddb5", "#7bccc4",
                               "#43a2ca", "#0868ac")) +
  ggtitle("Relative Height Metrics Dist. from Roads") +
  labs(fill = "Distance Rank")

#Display plot
roads_rhplot

#export plot
ggsave(roads_rhplot, filename = paste0(working_fold, "rh_roads_plot.png"),
       #width = 5, height = 3)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", out.height ="60%",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("external/presentation/roads_rhplot.png"))
```

# Results

## Relative Height Metrics and Distance from Roads

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", out.height ="60%",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("external/presentation/roads_rhplot.png"))
```

The boxplots shows that as distance from roads increases, the mean relative 
height for each level decreases. Low mean relative height in the underbrush 
could be due to management clearing practices. Negative outliers at level 25 
are values that fall below the elevation threshold.

## Relative Height Grid Metrics and Study Region Zones

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", out.height ="60%",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("external/presentation/rhplot.png"))
```

Similar to relative height metrics across variable road distances, we see more
observations in level 100 than other quartiles across the landscape zones. The 
national park sees the largest amount of relative height metric values across 
all levels. Relative height 100 does not appear to vary based on the study 
region zone.

## Mean Plant Area Index Grid Values and Study Region Zones

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", out.height ="60%",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("external/presentation/pai_zones.png"))
```

Mean PAI is higher in the national park with greater outliers then the buffer 
and the plantation. The buffer mean is 2.50, park mean is 2.73, and the cacao 
mean is 2.72. Greater PAI values are expected in the park due to its protected 
status. However, there is a striking similarity to  mean PAI in the Cacao 
fields. While we expect the national park to have greater PAI values due to its 
protected canopy cover, the area covered by the GEDI image primarily encompasses
the national park as opposed to the other two regions. The approximate number of
points that fall in each region are as follows: 8,000 in the park, 5,000 in the
park, and 4,500 in the cacao fields. Therefore, we can assume there is some 
sampling bias taking place here. 

# Discussion and Conclusions

In Conclusion, a preliminary analysis found some trends in GEDI metrics related 
to roads and stduy areas. As distances from roads increases, the mean relative 
height for each canopy level decreases. The National Park has the highest number 
of returns for all canopy height levels. The Plant Area Index has similar means 
across all study area zones. In order to discover more robust trends, more data 
within the study region should be downloaded and analyzed. For future work, we 
recommend ensuring that the user has plenty of free space for storing the data. 
The HDF5 files will quickly take up space. For additional analysis, GEDI data 
can be fused with landsat images to create high resolution maps of vegetation 
change. This is useful because of the lack of complete area covereage of gedi 
points. fusion with Landsat allows us to get a more clear look at a complete 
extent. 

The code within these vignettes can serve as an introductory to further work in 
the Amazonia region. We have arranged the R code to download GEDI data for 
specific dates and regions, convert data into shapefiles and data frames, clip
and intersect data to shapefiles and bounding boxes, summarize metric statistics 
in boxplots, and create maps of GEDI data. Besides working in Amazonia with the 
given date ranges, the bounding box and dates can be adjusted to fit other other
studies. The tools demoed, built, and demonstrated here can be applied wherever 
GEDI data is available.
