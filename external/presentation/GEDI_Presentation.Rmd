## Intro to Project

- GEDI is a full waveform LiDAR instrument launched December 5th, 2018
- GEDI produces the first high resolution laser ranging observations of the 3D structure of the Earth
- GEDI makes precise measurements of forest canopy height, canopy vertical structure, and surface elevation


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.pos="h"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("external/presentation/gedi_satellite.jpg"))
```

## GEDI in R
The raw waveforms and derived products are available online. Three different products will beused in this research:

- Level 1B: Geolocated waveforms (L1B);
- Level 2B: Canopy Cover Fraction and Leaf Area Index (L2B);
- Level 3B: Gridded canopy height metrics and variability (L3B);

The data was downloaded from USGS and they'are from 2019. 
```{r}

```

## Study Area

Cordillera Azul National Park in Peru was established in 1963. 
It spans 2,718,00 ha and protects the Ucayali moist forests ecoregion. 
The national park primarily consists of montane forests, but also has sections of dry forest to the West and Amazon rainforest to the East. 
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("external/presentation/study_area.png"))
```

the area includes the park, a a buffer around the park, and a cacao farming fields

## Relative Height Metrics

- Tree heights have long been measured as part of efforts to quantify timber resources.

- Metrics that provide information regarding the vertical distribution
of canopy vegetation.

- Measuring relative height is important to get an idea of canopy density at 
different levels

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("external/presentation/rh_explanation.png"))
```
Illustration how the resulting waveforms from returned laser pulses are used to determine relative height (Image courtesty of https://gedi.umd.edu/data/products/).

## Relative Height Metrics Over Roads
the effect of roads on relative canopy height is explored here:
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("external/presentation/roads_rhplot.png"))
```

- As distance from roads increases, the mean relative height for each level decreases
- Low mean relative height in the underbrush could be due to management clearing practices
- Negative outliers at level 25 are values that fall below the elevation threshold


## Mean Relative Height grid metrics across the extent
```{r, echo=FALSE}
RHmap <- here::here("external/presentation/rh_points.png")
RHplot <- here::here("external/presentation/rhplot.png")

```

```{r image_grobs, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "50%", fig.align = "default", echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(RHplot)

knitr::include_graphics(RHmap)

```

- Similiar to relative height metrics across variable road distances,
we see more observations in level 100 then other quartiles

- the national park sees the largest amount of realative height metric values across all levels

- 100 level relative height does not appear to varry based on geometry


## Mean Plant Area Index grid values between the Cacao plantation, Cordillera Azul National Park, and the park buffer 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
PAImap <- here::here("external/presentation/pai_points.png")
PAIplot <- here::here("external/presentation/pai_zones.png")

```

```{r image_grobs1, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "50%", fig.align = "default", echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(PAIplot)

knitr::include_graphics(PAImap)

```

- Mean PAI is higher in the national park with greater outliers then the buffer
and the plantation
